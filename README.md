# etch-a-sketch

This is the rough draft of the etch-a-sketch

To use it:
1. Have a empty div in on your page with id='container'
2. `new EtchASketch().build()`

No promises this will work for you. You can play with my implemetation at
ashersorensen.com/sign
and
ashersorensen.com/sketch

The sign endpoint is a troll ux form. The sketch endpoint will let you save your drawing

This is a not for profit fan project of a digital etch-a-sketch
